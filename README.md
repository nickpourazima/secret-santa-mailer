```

### Method 2: Using `setup.py`  

Install the package using setup.py:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

*Note: The setup.py method requires you to have setuptools installed. This method is an alternative to using pip and can be useful if you want to install the package system-wide.*

After completing either of the installation methods, you can proceed to configure and use Secret Santa Mailer as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) and [Usage](#usage) sections

## Configuration

Before running the Secret Santa Mailer script, you need to configure the sender information and participant data.

### Sender Configuration

Edit the sender.json file with your Gmail sender information and a Google Form link ([example](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPlYjnSOcHmqLqH5CbXe_Gn8PbPsXtGZ6SNku_9RvG75LkBQ/viewform?usp=sharing)) for gift preferences:

```json
[
    {
        "sender_email": "your.email@gmail.com",
        "app_password": "your_app_password",
        "google_form": "https://forms.google.com/your_form_link"
    }
]
```

### Participant Data

Edit the participants.json file with the details of your Secret Santa participants. Make sure each participant has a unique name, email (if available), and a group identifier:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Participant 1",
        "email": "participant1@gmail.com",
        "group": "Group A"
    },
    {
        "name": "Participant 2",
        "email": "participant2@gmail.com",
        "group": "Group B"
    },
    // Add more participants here...
]
```

## Usage

Run the Secret Santa Mailer script to generate and send assignments:

```bash
python secret_santa_mailer.py
```

The script will perform the following steps:

1. Randomly assign participants to each other, ensuring no one gets assigned to themselves or someone from the same group.
2. Send personalized email assignments to each participant.
3. Save participant assignments to a participant_assignments.json file (you can uncomment this option if needed).
